         <p>Ghana, formerly known as the Gold Coast, gained independence from British rule in 1957, 
            becoming the first sub-Saharan African nation to achieve this. Before independence, 
            the Gold Coast was inhabited by various Akan and other ethnic groups, including the Akwamus, 
            Ashanti Empire, and Ga. After contact with the Portuguese in the 15th century,
            trade with European states flourished, and the British established a Crown Colony in 1874.
            Kwame Nkrumah, the leader of the independence movement,
            became the first Prime Minister and later President of Ghana. </p>
